what are some other names for ETL processes?

Other names or closely related concepts for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process include Data Processing, Data Integration Pipeline, and Data Wrangling. While ETL is a specific type of data pipeline, other variations like ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) and alternative methods such as Data Virtualization and Stream Data Integration also serve similar data processing and integration goals. 
Here's a breakdown of related terms:
Variations and Alternatives:
ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): A variation where data is loaded first into the target system and then transformed, often becoming popular with cloud storage and big data. 
Data Pipeline: A more general term that describes any set of processes and tools used to move and process data, with ETL being a specific type of data pipeline. 
Stream Data Integration (SDI): A method for continuously consuming, transforming, and loading data streams in real time, rather than in batches. 
Data Virtualization: An approach that provides an integrated view of data without physically extracting, transforming, or loading it, creating virtual data repositories. 
Broader Concepts:
Data Processing: A broad term that encompasses the entire framework of steps involved in transforming data, which ETL does. 
Data Integration: The overall goal of ETL, which is to blend data from multiple sources into a single, centralized location. 
Data Wrangling: A more extensive set of data manipulation techniques that can overlap with the transformation step of ETL. 
Key takeaway: While ETL is a specific process, the terms above represent either variations of the process (like ELT), broader categories (like data processing), or alternative methods for achieving similar data integration and processing objectives.
