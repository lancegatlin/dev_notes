My default philosophy is to prefer the code reader over the code writer since code is read many more times than it is written. Because of this I don't generally don't use default values in ADT case classes. Using defaults and leaving fields out when initializing case classes forces unfamiliar readers to need to navigate to the case class declaration to understand what the defaults are. Also to see if there are perhaps fields left out in the initializing code that perhaps should be set to some value (a consideration that isn't necessary if there are no default values). Default values often times turn into bugs in serializers since they will let code compile that perhaps shouldn't at some unknown future point.

Also default values become problematic if they ever need to be changed since ever init code point has been re-evaluated since it was previously expecting the old default value.

I do like default ADT values in the companion object where a val is placed in the object that contains the default values (e.g. `val default=XYZ(...)`). These can have `.copy` applied for convenience when its desired and this prevents the compiler from auto-filling defaults where we perhaps don't intend them to be.
